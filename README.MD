# Retrosynthsis

Retrosynthesis is the process of going backwards from an ending chemical molecule and trying to find out what reactions generated it on a starting molecule.

To run the code, run MCTS.py and call the main function with the starting and ending smile. i.e. do
main(startsmile, endsmile)
